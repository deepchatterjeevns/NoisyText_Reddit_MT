## Machine translation for noisy Reddit text

In this project, we aim to build a neural machine translation model that translates noisy [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) posts from French into English. "Noisy" is defined as text with typos, grammar errors, code switching, textspeak, and other features common to social media / online domains. The input to our model will be the noisy Reddit post in French, and the output will be the equivalent Reddit post in English.
