# NoisyText_Reddit_MT

In this project, we aim to build a neural machine translation model that translates noisy Reddit posts from French into English. "Noisy" is defined as text with typos, grammar errors, code switching, textspeak, and other features common to social media / online domains. The input to our model will be the noisy Reddit post in French, and the output will be the equivalent Reddit post in English.
